The economy system is a basic one, money being currently earned by doing jobs.
There is also a banking system present, unfinished at the moment. ⌛
There is also a PayDay system which pays players every hour the salary from their faction or their active job.

# 💼 Jobs & Factions
There is currently only one job available on the server, which is Fisherman. 
The factions system is still WIP.

The Fisherman job is simple, go at the job place, use [/getjob] then go on the fishing spot and use [/fish].
Then go to a 24/7 store to automatically sell the fish and earn your money.
The more you fish, the more you increase in job experience, allowing to fish more than one fish before selling.(max to 3 fishes).

To quit your job, use [/quitjob]
